        5th Semester IT-Systems Engineering student, future software developer.
        My passion for computer science brought me to the Hasso Plattner
        Plattner Institution in Potsdam. Until last semester I completed
        Software Technic Course, which covers software life cycle, traditional
        development processes, extreme programming, debugging, etc. I love
        spending time to learn how to make my skills better and my current focus
        of learning is how to develop web(HTML, CSS, Jacascript).
